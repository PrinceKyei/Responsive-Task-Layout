            <h2>Task 1</h2>
            <p>
                Design a single HTML file that represents a blog post. Include a title, publication date,
                and author name. Add sections for an introduction, main content (with a list), and a
                conclusion. Insert at least one image and a "Read More" link at the end. Use
                semantic HTML tags to structure the layout properly.
            </p>
            <h2>Task 2</h2>
            <p>
                Design a product card using HTML and CSS. Include an image, product name, price, and
                an "Add to Cart" button. Style the card with CSS to ensure proper alignment and add
                effects to the button for a polished look.
            </p>
            <h2>Task 3</h2>
            <p>
                Design a webpage with four sections: a header, a sidebar, a main content area, and a
                footer. Use CSS to make the layout responsive, ensuring it looks good on all
                screen sizes. Apply media queries to switch between a grid layout for desktops and a
                stacked layout for mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h2>Task 4</h2>
            <p>
                Create a quiz application using JavaScript with at least 3 multiple-choice questions.
                Add functionality to move to the next question and display the score at the end.
                Ensure users cannot proceed without selecting an answer by adding basic validation.
            </p>
            <h2>Task 5</h2>
            <p>
                Create a to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include features to
                add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Use CSS to style the app and
                make it responsive for different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <h2>Task 6</h2>
            <p>
                Choose a simple webpage, like a product or company landing page, and recreate its
                layout and design using HTML and CSS. Add interactivity with JavaScript, such as a
                button or form functionality, to make it more dynamic.
