                    Design a single HTML file that represents a blog post. Include a title, publication date,
                    and author name. Add sections for an introduction, main content (with a list), and a
                    conclusion. Insert at least one image and a "Read More" link at the end. Use
                    semantic HTML tags to structure the layout properly.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main">
                <h2>Task 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Design a product card using HTML and CSS. Include an image, product name, price, and
                    an "Add to Cart" button. Style the card with CSS to ensure proper alignment and add
                    effects to the button for a polished look.
                </p>

            <section class="main">
                <h2>Task 3</h2>
                <p>
                    Design a webpage with four sections: a header, a sidebar, a main content area, and a
                    footer. Use CSS to make the layout responsive, ensuring it looks good on all
                    screen sizes. Apply media queries to switch between a grid layout for desktops and a
                    stacked layout for mobile devices.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h2>Task 4</h2>
                <p>
                    Create a quiz application using JavaScript with at least 3 multiple-choice questions.
                    Add functionality to move to the next question and display the score at the end.
                    Ensure users cannot proceed without selecting an answer by adding basic validation.

            <section class="main">
                <h2>Task 5</h2>
                <p>
                    Create a to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include features to
                    add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Use CSS to style the app and
                    make it responsive for different screen sizes.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main">
                <h2>Task 6</h2>
                <p>
                    Choose a simple webpage, like a product or company landing page, and recreate its
                    layout and design using HTML and CSS. Add interactivity with JavaScript, such as a
                    button or form functionality, to make it more dynamic.
